# Status

Produce a terse, read-only orientation report for the current project.

This prompt complements the [Status Reporting skill](../../SKILL.md). Follow
the numbered steps when a focused project-orientation report is needed.

## Steps

1. **Identity**: Confirm which project this is and read the active branch (`git branch --show-current`).
2. **Git state**: Report uncommitted file count and the latest commit subject.
3. **Continuity**: Read `HANDOFF.md` if present; summarize `In progress`, pending queue,
   and resume point. Do not re-litigate closed decisions.
4. **Brain health**: If your project ships brain-QA muscles (Alex ACT uses):

   ```pwsh
   node scripts/brain-qa.cjs
   node scripts/brain-semantic-qa.cjs
   ```

   Otherwise skip and note absence in the report.

5. **Output**: Lead with material state, then blockers and next action. Omit
   empty sections.

## Boundaries

- Never modify sibling projects or native memory during status work.
- Never infer health from a stale dashboard without naming its date.
- Do not commit, pull, or push.
- Repository absence is not evidence of retirement.

## Would Revise If

Revisit by **2026-10-28** if the handoff format changes, brain-QA muscles cease
to represent brain health for projects that ship them, or status reports repeatedly
omit a material blocker present in current repository evidence.
